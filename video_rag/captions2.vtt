WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.764
so hi everyone

00:00:00.764 --> 00:00:03.659
in this video we're discussing my learning framework when

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.100
I'm trying to learn a new technology

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.923
what do I mean by technology well

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.825
full stack development, web 3, webRTC, AI

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.400
all of these are things that have intrigued me

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.440
over the past few years and there's a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.880
very specific framework that I've used

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.160
to learn these, Target these get jobs in

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.720
these and become like pretty good at

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.460
them so that I can 1. earn money and

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.260
2. be very proficient in these skills if

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.000
you do like my learning framework and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.859
want to learn besides me I am launching

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.539
something very soon if you would like to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.099
know about that feel free to subscribe

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.380
to either my substack, Discord or my

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.880
telegram Channel that's where I'll be

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.620
announcing it first and eventually I may

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.480
or may not release it on YouTube so if

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.800
you would like to know about this first

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.239
feel free to join any one of these

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.680
groups with that let's get right into

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.059
the video so this video is going to be

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.800
broken down into five parts in the first

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.480
four parts I'll be introducing four new

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.399
terminologies these are goal driven learning

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.379
learning before earning

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.001
question driven development and

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.980
tutorial hell in the fifth part I am going to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.600
show you my framework and using these

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.160
four terminologies in what I am trying

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.719
to learn next which is writing low

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.760
latency code in languages like rust and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.379
C plus pass so let's begin with the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.476
first one the first one is

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:04.799
goal driven development so when we get into tech for

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.420
most people we either take a computer

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.860
science degree because well a lot of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.119
people have told us there's a lot of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.460
money here and for most people 99% of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.200
people there is some money based

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.420
monetary motivation to get into the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.520
field of computer science this is very

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.320
good and that was the case for me as

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.119
well in fact up until my first semester

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.280
I did not code at all only in my second

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.380
semester did I begin to code because I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420
got my first goal which was Google

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.400
summer of code and more importantly

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.740
making like $5500 through the summer so

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.720
what is goal driven learning goal driven

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.159
learning is when you have a very

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.140
specific goal in mind which is usually

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.299
related to money and that's your primary

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.400
motivation to sort of get into computer

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.380
science or learn a specific technology

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.720
for example a goal for me right now is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.600
to learn how coding happens in HFT firms

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.799
and what's the reason behind it well

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.119
there is some monetary benefit there

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.560
because these companies pay a lot of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.939
money these goals would be very small

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.640
for example getting a $200 gig on upwork

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.500
or making it to Google summer of code to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.600
make $2500 whatever they pay now or

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.759
getting like a first 12 lakh per annum

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.680
package or maybe joining a startup that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.119
you've really wanted to and that you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.500
know it pays really well in India the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.060
reason goal driven learning is good is

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.739
because since you have an end goal

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.260
this is like sort of related to IIT jee

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.060
preparation we have like an end goal of

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.860
giving an examination which is why

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.239
very structured learning that happens

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.099
over two years versus if you don't have

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.840
an end goal it's very easy to sort of do

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.280
10 things at the same time machine

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.900
learning AI where three full stack

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.819
development and not do very concentrated

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.319
learning if you have a goal you know

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.879
what to do and more specifically what

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.500
not to do for the next few months so

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.239
that you achieve that goal once once you

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.620
achieve that goal you can decide whether

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.819
this is what you want to do for the rest

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.379
of your life or if you want a new goal

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.180
now but if you have a goal you sort of

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.800
have something to work towards you can

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.599
see some light at the end of the tunnel

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.160
which I think especially in Tech which

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.660
is a very difficult field to understand

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.099
if you're a complete beginner and just

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.599
beginning to get into it if you have a

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.040
goal at the end your motivation is

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.480
really high through this journey and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.940
whatever obstacles come which quite

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.140
frankly they will especially if you're

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.700
trying to learn a new technology at

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.660
least you have something to look forward

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.400
to at the end of the tunnel you may make

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.660
it you may not make it but the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.800
motivation that you have through this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.660
journey is much higher if you have an

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.099
end goal in mind so I would strongly

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.780
suggest at this point that you sort of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.120
choose a specific goal which could be

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.099
okay I want my first 12 lakh package or

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.420
if you're currently working already I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.980
want my first remote offer for fifty

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.599
thousand dollars or if you already make

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.819
like I don't know 50-60 lakh rupees in

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.800
India I want my first sort of 100K offer

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.360
200k offer from a company in the US

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.920
These are nice goals that I sort of keep

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.360
in my head as well and the reason I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.099
think they work is because we're all

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.019
humans and most of us are like not

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.280
inherently interested in computer

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.140
science we're in here for the money if

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.640
you have a monetary goal in mind it's

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.200
easier for you to reach there so I would

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.640
strongly suggest at this point you sort

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.140
of decide that first of all of course

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.700
don't be extremely ambitious to begin

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.860
with and make sure you have a group of

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.420
people who are targeting the same goal

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.099
that also makes this journey extremely

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.659
smooth and that sort of my goal with

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.220
what I'm introducing very soon with that

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.599
let's move to the second point the

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.400
second point is called learning before

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.319
earning this is something that a senior

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.700
of mine introduced to me I've talked

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.200
about the senior a few times on my

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.239
channel my senior the person who was

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.220
laughing in the last year in my

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.680
contributions uh this time saw this

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.360
email that guy was like he's a Super

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.368
Genius, he did GSoC thrice

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:07.260
not even twice back then you

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.259
could do this or three times

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.739
I saw the senior had done GSoC Thrice he had

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.140
the best offers in India yet he decided

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.659
to go for his Masters in the US

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.220
completed his Masters worked at Facebook

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.918
AI for like a few years and now is a

00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:21.298
very well positioned to make a lot of

00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:22.860
money in the coming Bull Run in fact

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.120
this is the senior I'm going to be

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.919
talking to when I start to learn AI and

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.180
he'll sort of guide me on what to do

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.740
what not to do and this decision of him

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.419
not taking a job in India and going for

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.639
his Masters learning before earning is

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.960
something that sort of served him very

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.400
well so you have a very long career of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.199
40 years if you have to take breaks in

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.759
the middle you should do it if you think

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:39.960
it will benefit you in the long term

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.759
feel free to take a pause decide what

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.139
you want to do next and then maybe

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.120
Sprint more practically let's say if

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.040
you're getting a job offer for three

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.960
lakh per annum from some service based

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.820
company and if you feel like upscaling

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.620
on the next six months and then getting

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.000
a job that will pay you like 12 lakh per

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.560
annum I think that's a decent compromise

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.020
to make again everyone's situation is

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.460
different you may or may not be able to

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.919
take this bet but as I said the senior

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.240
had the best offers in India and he did

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.620
not really belong to the most affluent

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.419
family yet he decided to go for his

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.220
Masters in fact Masters in the US is

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.660
pretty expensive so he ended up paying a

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.979
lot of money but still it was the right

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.080
decision so if you have these sort of

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.180
small checkpoints in your journey where

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.680
someone is offering you something

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.419
extremely below standard or if you're

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.620
working at a startup where you're not

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.000
learning anything there's like a lot of

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.320
grunt work that's happening or you're

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.120
doing some testing work that you feel is

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.740
going to get replaced eventually you

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.000
should definitely spend some time

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.560
learning even if it takes a few months

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.000
of you not earning and then eventually

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.380
what you'll make is much more basically

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.580
what you would have made in these six

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.259
months you'll end up making like a month

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:35.699
or two if of course your journey is

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:36.960
right so you have to make sure you keep

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.160
other things in mind that I'm talking

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.539
about throughout the video but if you

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.291
have the option of learning before earning

00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.060
always go for learning

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.560
eventually it will have huge

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.880
implications in your life I'll give

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.259
another example I've worked at Goldman

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:48.180
Sachs was a very good job offer like 30LPA

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.920
after taxes I would make like

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.620
1-1.5 lakh rupees per month which is pretty

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.000
good in Bangalore but I ended up taking

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.460
a break of three months deciding what to

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.840
do next started freelancing and then

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.460
sort of that offer went up and up if I

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.139
did not take that leap of faith I'd

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.759
still be working at Goldman Sachs making

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:04.020
like 2 lakh rupees per month or whatever

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.479
which is also great but taking a break

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:07.979
made a lot of sense for me because I

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.300
knew that was not the right company for

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.520
me and I could acquire skills eventually

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.620
that would pay me much more so even

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.060
though it was a scary decision back then

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.860
eventually I ended up paying well and so

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.360
if you have the option of learning and

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.039
of course have the Liberty to leave a

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.960
job or not get paid for a few months I

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.300
would suggest spending some time months

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.979
or Years Learning and then diving right

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.080
back into earthing cool with that let's

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.580
move to the third point so the third

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.319
terminology I want to introduce is

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.360
called question driven development this

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.500
is a term that's been recently

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.240
introduced and what it means is whenever

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.860
you're trying to learn a new technology

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.380
don't dive into tutorials talk to

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.300
someone who's good in this field or has

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.160
been working in this field and ask them

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.780
what they do on a day-to-day basis maybe

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.639
ask them to break it down into a project

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.380
then break down the project into

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.240
multiple small questions and Implement

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.354
these one by one I'm going to repeat this again 

00:06:53.354 --> 00:06:54.300
if you want to learn a new

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.819
technology for example you want to learn

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:57.900
node.js I would suggest you start with

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.580
the goal so the goal could be I want to

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.680
join a startup in India that pays me 12

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.300
lakh per annum okay what is the startup

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.103
use it uses the MERN stack okay

00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:06.900
how do I learn the MERNstack through question

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.819
driven development basically ask a

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:10.560
person in this company what do you work

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.000
on on a day-to-day basis and can you

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.800
break it down into a small project for

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.419
me if possible could you break the

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.100
project down into small prompts or

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.020
questions that can each be implemented

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.940
in less than 100 lines of code this is

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.139
sort of the gist of question driven

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.699
development it's basically you breaking

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.340
down a very complex project into small

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.560
subtasks each subtask should be able to

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.000
be done in less than 100 lines of code

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.560
and you should do this independently

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.539
without the help of any tutorial you can

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.340
look at docs you can maybe talk to chat

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.780
gbt to understand things from the high

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.460
level do not look at any tutorial and

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.840
anyways tutorials are sort of structured

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.160
in a certain way if you want to break it

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.780
down into multiple tasks and want to do

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.220
these individually you won't be able to

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.479
find a tutorial that will help you out

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.280
exactly in the end I'll show you the

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.139
project and the sub tasks that my friend

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:51.780
from one of these HFT firms gave me but

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.400
the idea here is break down a big

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.900
project into smaller sub projects in

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.160
fact I have a repo Linked In the

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.660
description in which I have a bunch of

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.220
projects for learning the MERN stack or

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.139
like full stack development and a bunch

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.000
of small subtasks that you can do each

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.860
of these subtasks can be done in less

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.139
than 100 lines of code so do these one

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:08.280
by one and this is what is sort of

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:09.780
called question driven development where

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.419
you do not look at a tutorial you solve

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:14.039
small problems and then eventually merge

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.599
all the small problems together to build

00:08:15.599 --> 00:08:17.280
a very big project and now you

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.660
understand all of these things from the

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.580
fundamentals if possible make sure you

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.780
get this project from a friend who's

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:23.639
currently working in the industry at a

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:25.319
specific company that you aim to work at

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.819
with that let's move to the fourth point

00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.500
the fourth terminology I want to

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.900
introduce here is called

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.599
 tutorial hell

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:32.458
it's basically something I did back in

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:33.839
the day as well if you have seen this

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.399
channel called the New Boston it used to

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.659
be sort of very popular back in the day

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.580
when I was in college I downloaded the

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.200
complete Android development playlist

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.000
and I basically brought it back home

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.080
because I did not have good internet

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.760
here and I went through all these

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.320
tutorials where I followed what he was

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.600
doing this is a very nice Channel and

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.040
tutorials generally are great in fact

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.839
I've created a few tutorials of mine as

00:08:51.839 --> 00:08:53.279
well on full stack development but if

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.140
you look at my tutorials I usually don't

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.180
do everything I sort of leave things for

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.279
you guys to implement by your own and

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:01.200
that's sort of one way to do tutorials

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.700
generally I don't recommend looking at

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.899
tutorials at all because you're

00:09:03.899 --> 00:09:05.279
following someone you're basically

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:06.420
coding what they're doing it's just like

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.040
a very manual task and you're sort of

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.360
not learning how things are happening

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.620
under the hood for example this playlist

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.000
sort of helps you make a very nice

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.320
mobile application which I did back in

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.180
the day but if you ask me to code such

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.620
an application today in fact even if you

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.820
ask me how I can like create a simple

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.560
application with a button in Android you

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.940
won't be able to do it why because I

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.620
haven't built real world projects by

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.600
myself I've just copied someone in fact

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.680
looked at the screen on the left hand

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.180
coded the same thing on the right that

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.680
will usually not get you anywhere that's

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.360
sort of what a tutorial hell is you

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.980
looking at a tutorial following the

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.779
tutorial completely but you're still not

00:09:33.779 --> 00:09:36.000
able to get a job or reach your goal or

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.120
sort of build projects that these

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.440
companies want you to build because

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.580
while you've sort of followed someone

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.019
you know what they have done and if

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:43.980
someone asks you to build the same thing

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.180
you might be able to do it that too

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.980
frankly for a few days because it's sort

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.600
of muscle memory that you were able to

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.820
follow them if someone asks you to build

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.500
the same thing in like two months you

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.519
won't be able to do it because well

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.080
you've forgotten about it sort of the JEE

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.700
way of learning you're sort of cramming

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.200
a few things while following a tutorial

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.480
so strong recommended addition to not

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.680
follow tutorials work on

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.240
project-based learning like look out for

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.160
a lot of assignments see how real world

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.300
projects are built and then start

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.860
building them on your own of course

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.120
don't start with a very complex project

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.500
how should you start you should start

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.820
with question driven development

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.380
breaking it down into subtasks and then

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.480
implementing them one by one cool with

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.500
that let's move to the fifth point

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.700
something you might have been waiting

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.380
for which is how I'm learning to become

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.060
a low latency developer in one of these

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.220
HFT firms so what's my goal my goal is

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.260
to get a 4 CR offer like a very big

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.120
offer or like more specifically like

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.472
understand how things happen but

00:10:29.472 --> 00:10:30.899
why do these companies pay so much money

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.459
through these hft developers why is

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:34.620
every year like someone from IIT making

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.200
getting like a very Hefty package in New

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.760
York or Chicago where these companies

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.560
are based and what exactly they do on a

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.480
day-to-day basis so I talked to a friend

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.800
who works in New York in one of these

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.720
companies and he gave me a good rundown

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.880
of what happens in these companies and

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.380
it was frankly very overwhelming so I

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.640
asked him to break it down into a small

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.800
project the project that he gave me is

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.500
build a very simple trading system

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.060
more specifically build like a real-time

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.060
system that lets you sort of send some

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.860
data from your client to a server and

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.140
then lets other people subscribe to

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.700
these updates so if you've ever looked

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.980
at zerodha and I mean you sort of know

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.180
where I'm getting with this I sort of

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.500
contribute to zerodha in my last video

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.240
as well zerotdha's application lets you

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.700
place trades which is like give me 10

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.860
stocks of tata and then those trades are

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.600
executed and the price sort of goes up

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.980
and down you can see that price in real

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.360
time he basically asked me to build

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.740
something similar doesn't have to be a

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.180
trading application he said it can be a

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.040
simple sat application as well as long

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.260
as it's written in C, C++ or rust

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.760
one of these languages and the way he

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.990
broke it down for me was

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.475
 1. understandhow websocket servers are written inthese languages 

00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:36.876
2. understand how data transmission happens

00:11:36.876 --> 00:11:39.191
3. understand how data compression happens 

00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:41.220
and 4. understand how you can reasonably

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.079
distribute your servers in order to have

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:44.640
minimum latency when you are trying to

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.740
place an order so that's my goal for the

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.420
next one month or so I'm going to

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.220
implement this application that sort of

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.420
looks similar to a trading application

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.279
similar to Zerodha, written in rust has

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.779
a websocket server lets you place an

00:11:54.779 --> 00:11:56.040
order and I have to make sure that I

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.420
place the order with the minimum latency

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.980
which happens if I am very close to the

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.899
server or I'm sending very small data so

00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.640
I have to compress data as much as I can

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.620
I've also linked this project in the

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.060
repo in the description so feel free to

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.560
look at it with that hopefully you

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.940
understand my learning framework I'll

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.620
make another video in a month where I'll

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.180
tell you how I was able to build the

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.560
project what project I built I'll open

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.360
source it feel free to look at that as

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.980
well with that let's end the video I'll

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.060
see you guys in the next one bye
