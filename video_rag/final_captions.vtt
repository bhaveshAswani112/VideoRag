placement into an hft that pays this

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.360
much he worked a lot in open source had

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.799
a lot of rejections contributed to

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.680
multiple repositories used that leverage

just very good at very high agency very

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.599
good at doing things that he's been

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.560
given and also a lot of bets that he

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.560

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.640
you 50

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.439
what are the salary ranges because I

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.000
wasn't looking for jobs back then

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.120
right 400

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.030
[Laughter]

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.120
100 this was when C he was one of the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.560
best students I was just starting the

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.519
process of referrals so when he gave me

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.800
this number there was no company other

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.160
than backpack that I knew that would

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.199
hire at this range um so that was the

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:27.639
first refl that I gave him which was

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.800
back in like 2 years ago or something

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.360
think um 2023 2023 July yeah around that

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.919
time uh I remember I was in Dubai I was

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.400
just about to move to Japan and he built

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.160
a very clean assignment he told

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.039
me but still in like two days he built a

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.800
clone of binance which is what backpack

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.080
was toally moving to as well building an

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.960
exchange uh it didn't work out in the

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.160
end but I saw very high uh agency over

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
there K Joi bu when the project came

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.120
even though it came like a day later it

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.120
was very polished U and you know he also

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.639
took a class in cohort one which was on

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:03.840
JavaScript Asing promises which had

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.280
pretty mixed feedbacks honestly uh they

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.520
were very bipolar feedbacks some people

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.440
loved it some people hated it I'll post

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.400
that session somewhere on the other

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.360
channel 100ex STS um it's a very nice

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.199
channel on or a very nice talk on how

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.160
you should be learning um but again only

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.440
meant for high agency people because

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.919
it's very self-driven one of his core

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.120
learnings or thesis back then

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.199
was and you'll see that in that session

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.639
as well so that's where we started uh

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.560
and I remember Delhi me Bangalore Meetup

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.919
may we met again um and from there you

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.160
sort of started your own Journey so

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.800
would love to knowah say what all did

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.479
you

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:41.280
do so in

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.280
Bangalore I met

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.560
you after that I was I was in third year

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.919
college

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.039
then and then

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.479
um so then I thought ke um let's let's

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.400
start uh following an example that

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.599
you've said so one

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.400
of the the biggest things that helped me

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.199
was your video on the backpack open

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:14.199
source

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.520
contributions so I tried to replicate

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.280
that a few times first time I tried to

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.960
replicate that was this uh YC company

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.800
called light Dash I think YC

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.319
2020

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.120
exact to I contributed

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.000
I got I think 7 eight PRS merged and I

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.280
had a few like seven eight more open and

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.400
after

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.120
that generally the feedback from people

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.880
from the developers was ke this is good

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.199
but then the CTO said ke we don't have

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:47.319
the band with to view to review your

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.880
work and generally everybody's work they

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.479
just they just shut down and they

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.280
focused on their core team so that was a

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.080
dead end but that those seven PRS they

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.639
gave me some leverage that I have this

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:03.160
open source

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.720
contribution in this 4,000 star

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.599
repository so then I used that to apply

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.479
to places one of the people I reached

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.720
out to was sahil sahil

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.160
lavingia and

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.080
um I messaged him so he had a hiring

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.919
tweet he were hiring people email me if

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:24.560
interested so I reached out to him and I

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.680
told him I've contributed to this I uh

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.240
linked the project I made

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.960
which

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.000
um you asked me to do and

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.680
reject then I started looking for more

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.120
open source repositories I think in

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.440
September um there was this open source

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.280
repository tiny grad which is um Run by

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.720
George Hots that was in AI so I thought

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.479
ke this is worth a shot I didn't know

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.159
anything about a or even now I don't

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:58.400
know anything about a but I thought

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.680
maybe some of the easier things I could

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.080
to try to do some

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.800
jugar so I got a few PRS merged by

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.319
himme my ultimate goal was to get some

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:12.759
bounties uh so he has a sheet Google

00:08:12.759 --> 00:08:15.360
sheet of like $200 Bounty solve this you

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.199
get $200 Sol this you get $1,000 I tried

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:20.960
to do that but balancing college with

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.560
that was very very

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.599
hard so that also didn't work out I had

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:27.560
like two contributions in dinr and then

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.720
I thought no this is probably not then I

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.400
focused on College until I think

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.240
December December May when my break

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.120
happened

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.800
then then I started aggressively look

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.120
like applying um and looking for

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.920
opportunities in

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.560
January two things happened one thing

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.120
that happened was that sahil tweeted

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.120
he's coming to India and he posted a

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.880
link to a telegram

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.680
group so I thought yeah but and he was

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.480
coming to my city he was coming to Delhi

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.440
Bangalore and I don't remember the last

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.040
one so he came to Delhi and I met him

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.440
didn't talk about a job I was at the

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.800
time I was also interested in startups

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.240
how this stuff works and I was gum roads

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.440
of beautiful thing that he's built like

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.040
gumro alumni

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.959
are have built billion dollar companies

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:25.920
there's this former person who worked at

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.360
gumroad Michel

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.640
Hashimoto to he he co-founded Hashi

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.560
which is I think worth some 13 142

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.760
billion um and then there was also this

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.920
other guy Sid yadav at

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.720
gumroad who also built Circle doso which

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.560
is also a very big company and gumroad

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.519
just been this very very unique Place uh

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:52.240
that s's managed to create generate a

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.360
lot of interest in lots of people are

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.120
very interested in gumro so I was

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.680
interested in that and I wanted to know

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.480
what happens how you do it generally and

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.360
just listen to him talk uh there were

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.800
two sessions when he came uh one was um

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.839
just a Q&A with another host there were

00:10:12.839 --> 00:10:14.560
like 50 people sitting I was sitting I

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:17.480
raised my hand they didn't pick

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.560
me so there was an after party sort of

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.440
thing after

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.720
party it was just a

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.399
Meetup it was just like sah just talking

00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:31.320
for hours on end

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.200
eventually he left but uh I try to get

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.079
in get as much information and try to do

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.800
things to keep him to keep me in his

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.760
mind uh so that he remembers and

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:56.040
everything I try to keep natural

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.360
very

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.959
well the second thing that happened in

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:10.160
January was I got very very lucky that

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.120
this open- Source repository which used

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.560
the same stack as my contributions as

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.320
the light Dash thing that I contributed

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.720
to before it became open source and it

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.160
was becoming popular very very quickly

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.519
very

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.200
quickly

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.839
to I think when I saw it 10,000 stars

00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:34.240
and there was a tweet with 500,000

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.399
Impressions uh which was posted I think

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.760
a few days

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.160
ago I

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.720
thought the top people on this they very

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.360
very new so maybe I can do something

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.160
here because I have some leverage from

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.440
the previous stuff I did so then I

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.079
started

00:11:53.079 --> 00:11:56.519
contributing um I luckily ended up

00:11:56.519 --> 00:12:00.160
winning a bounty a $250 bount County and

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.839
I became the number two highest

00:12:02.839 --> 00:12:05.279
contributor on the

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:08.170
repository so then I

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.360
[Music]

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.360
thought

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.600
number um I reached out to him I told

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.199
him ke I I this is open source is one of

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:23.320
my favorite things this is remote this

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.399
is an awesome opportunity I I'd love to

00:12:26.399 --> 00:12:29.560
sort of be a part of this and um this is

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.240
the work I've done so

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.320
far the

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.320
problem he had this company that he open

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.440
sourced he had founded in 2020 and he he

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.120
had to shut it down because it wasn't

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.680
financially viable so here he wanted to

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.360
save costs so understandably he only

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.440
picked people he had worked with before

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.440
so the the same team from

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.480
2022 that he

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.680
picked

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.079
to but I had that uh

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:03.240
in the top two contributors in the repo

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.920
so I had that thing as leverage to show

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.680
people so then I started applying to

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.720
companies there was this company

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.040
million.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.639
JS

00:13:13.639 --> 00:13:19.000
uh I applied um I got they gave me an

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.440
assignment I applied to a lot more other

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.959
companies like hundreds of companies I

00:13:22.959 --> 00:13:25.199
must have apply to and lots of people

00:13:25.199 --> 00:13:26.680
ghosted me and then I started being

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.839
active on Twitter as well I made some

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:31.199
small small side project tried to make

00:13:31.199 --> 00:13:35.199
it go viral didn't go viral but then it

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:36.839
was something that some people found

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:40.480
interesting so who luckily I could use

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.959
as a leverage to show Founders key I

00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:48.560
have I can do something so proof of work

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.920
I try to produce as much

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.560
of

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.800
then I reached out to sahil with that

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.720
maybe

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.680
contribution and um initially he

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.560
said board meeting cro has four public

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.160
board meetings every year so the next

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.000
one at that time was 15th

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.240
Feb we've stopped hiring we'll only

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.040
start hiring after the board meeting so

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.639
then I waited until the board

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:19.600
meeting in the board meeting he gave he

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.560
said ke if if you're looking for a job

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.279
at gumroad solve this particular problem

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.759
he gave a non-coding problem a general

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:29.639
logic problem

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:31.720
uh I can go into more detail if you'd

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.040
like but then I I somehow ended up

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.639
solving that problem and I was I think

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:38.959
like one of the only two people who

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:42.600
solved that problem and

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.560
um so then he got impressed by that he

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:46.959
asked

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:50.399
me so and I I ended up delivering a

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:51.800
little more on that problem I'll go into

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.600
detail if you'd like yeah that'd be good

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.959
what was the problem statement okay the

00:14:55.959 --> 00:15:00.320
problem statement was that um

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.639
so there was a zoom

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:06.160
meeting you had multiple people all of

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.040
them had the cameras on like this was

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.399
actually it's a board meeting right they

00:15:09.399 --> 00:15:11.360
have their cameras on

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.720
S if you're looking for jobs at

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.279
gumroad give me a rough floor layout of

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:23.360
the place where this meeting is

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.399
happening and tell me the positions

00:15:26.399 --> 00:15:29.000
where everybody is sitting to you had to

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.120
figure that out from where everybody was

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.920
sitting

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:41.279
backg he was trying to test that so

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:46.319
that I sort of figured out but what

00:15:46.319 --> 00:15:48.079
additional thing I did which I was very

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.600
very lucky at doing by the way ke I

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.920
actually found the exact building they

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.000
were in the exact floor they were in

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.720
um where the board meeting was happening

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.399
and I actually found the actual floor

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:05.440
plan of that floor nice and so when I

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.040
sent that to S he got a little

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.160
spooked but then when I explained it to

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.800
him he was

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:17.079
like um so by background there was a

00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:20.880
building I had to do some reverse

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.920
searching but luckily the building

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.600
opposite was a very famous building

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.759
photography and it was

00:16:29.759 --> 00:16:33.000
Stanford Bridge

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
York

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.800
that's but um I I came up with something

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.360
which I thought this sah might like and

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.560
then I submitted that to him he said ke

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.759
good good um let's do a

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:52.480
call so then call call me he asked me

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.040
general questions

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.880
ke we talked about gumroad no technical

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.959
interview it was just a culture fi call

00:16:58.959 --> 00:17:01.040
for some context the gumroad interview

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.880
process is first you

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.039
start first you reach out to S via email

00:17:07.039 --> 00:17:09.839
right and then you get on a call Fe

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:12.079
after the call there's a work trial and

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.919
then if you pass the work trial

00:17:14.919 --> 00:17:18.520
you get accepted into the company so I

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.640
was at the call stage call stage may we

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.919
generally talked

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:25.919
about gumro new features he told me that

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.360
uh we're becoming a merchant of record

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.640
basically so gumroad is an e-commerce

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.600
platform so Merchant of record means he

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.160
in like we'll also be collecting tax

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.280
from um sellers

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.000
Etc so we talked about that we talked

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.400
about other features and he asked

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.600
me how do you pay your bills at that

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.960
time I wasn't really paying my bills

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.720
because I didn't have a job but uh uh

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.000
luckily I had done some I had done the

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.960
this um freelancing gig at this other

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.799
web3 company which was doing

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:05.280
decentralized

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.280
di I built uh this

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.960
transpiler uh which basically transpiled

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.480
like Onyx onx is a way to represent

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.120
machine learning models right so from

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.120
Onyx to their own custom framework P say

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.480
there they have their own custom

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.919
framework ml go Ino so I had to build a

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:33.440
transpiler I built it in Python which uh

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.840
transpiled Onyx code an onyx file to

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.159
mlco to that was also part of a work

00:18:41.159 --> 00:18:43.120
trial it wasn't a

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.480
freelance freelance technically like on

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.080
contract it was freelance so I can also

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.919
say that but it was a work trial so then

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:53.840
I used that as a way to say this is what

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.159
I've been doing recently and maybe he

00:18:57.159 --> 00:18:59.720
knew he talked to me about maybe how

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.400
much of it is your codee so I honestly

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.960
said okay only a few thousand lines of

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.799
my

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:07.200
code just I think a thousand or S lines

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.120
of my baky relatively new to the project

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.440
but I've been instantly able to

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.400
contribute uh I've been instantly

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.159
productive from day one and if you drop

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:18.679
me in any code base I'll be instantly

00:19:18.679 --> 00:19:21.280
productive that's the pitch I

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.200
made

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.520
uh call went well he said okay fine

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.919
let's do a work trial just tell me

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:31.640
Monday which you would like to start and

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.120
let's do that so I was very happy uh

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.039
then I just followed up on him to just

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.559
confirm

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:40.120
because

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.280
like there's there's that fear when

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.200
you're looking for for jobs people will

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.320
ghost you that's very at least I had

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.039
that big fear so I was constantly

00:19:49.039 --> 00:19:51.799
following up with

00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:56.360
people constantly following up just to

00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:01.240
confirm any Monday right chat um yeah

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.120
just uh build

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.159
a um the specific phrasing was I'd build

00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:09.720
a Ruby on Rails project if I were you

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.919
because the gumro stack is in Ruby on

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.400
Rails and then any Monday

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.400
works it's a recommendation he's just

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.880
recommending me I build this so I try to

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.559
build it huani I thought I'll learn on

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.679
the job

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:27.600
um so but I reached out to him ke okay

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.280
does next Monday work he said where's

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.080
the

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.280
challenge I

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.720
was and then it's a bad impression as

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.159
well he was thinking something else I'm

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:43.919
thinking something else so then I didn't

00:20:43.919 --> 00:20:46.400
reply anything two weeks I think two or

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.720
three I don't remember two or three

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.720
weeks just spent grinding my head on

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.400
Ruby on Rails and I built this thing

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.799
called neat Royale neat Royale is

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:58.360
basically like a battle royale for neat

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.159
question questions like you have 100

00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:01.960
players

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.280
um and uh like you have 60 seconds to

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.159
solve a question the person who's the

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:08.960
slowest solving the question gets kicked

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.480
out so that was the thing I I think it

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.640
was active until a few months ago for

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.000
AWS

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.400
bills nobody was using it so I shut it

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.120
down NE royal.com I still have the

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.039
domain I think uh maybe it's expired so

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:28.039
then that happened so I built that I

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:30.520
sent it him and there were a lot of

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.919
unconventional Technologies like I was

00:21:32.919 --> 00:21:34.760
using websockets Ruby on Rails

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.120
equivalent of websockets is action cable

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.880
so I used that and then I built a fully

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.640
functioning thing it was realtime

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.679
communication to generally I thought

00:21:44.679 --> 00:21:47.720
this is hopefully this works but this is

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:52.240
more effort than a normal uh sort of run

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.960
off the M

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.600
project and IDE and S likes these kinds

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.240
of funky ideas yes

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.000
so then I sent that and then he said oh

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.400
looks good um let's start next

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.000
Monday how fragile these things are and

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.400
how careful you need to be and how lucky

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.039
you need to be um I was also applying to

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.720
a few other companies where I was in the

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.000
interview rounds at this point

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.960
I got the work

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.520
trial

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.279
and once I got the work trial I was a

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:41.000
little more confident because I could

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.240
use this work trial as a next jumping

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.039
point like I use maybe gumroad work is

00:22:46.039 --> 00:22:49.480
also something that is not completely

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:54.159
for it might raise some eyes the if the

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.559
doesn't work out I'll write a blog or

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:58.919
I'll write a tweet then I'll Focus I'll

00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:00.600
get some Impressions get some people

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.200
seeing my work seeing nroyal and Fair

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.000
perhaps we can do

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.039
something gumroad work trial was also um

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:13.360
it was it was fun but it was also

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:19.159
very lots of uncertainty lots of uh uh

00:23:19.159 --> 00:23:23.679
stress but um

00:23:23.679 --> 00:23:26.760
so gamka work trial usually lasts from

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.720
four to 6 weeks mine ended up lasting

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.840
two

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:36.880
months and um two months May sah told me

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.840
later there was something wrong in the

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.000
Cod base which wasn't allowing people to

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.679
perform some something documentation Etc

00:23:47.679 --> 00:23:49.760
so then he he

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.840
said initially you weren performing but

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.679
then we realized generally you there was

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:57.360
another person with me so you and this

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.880
other guy generally good so I think we

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.919
should change our

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:06.919
U whatever methods we use so then I got

00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:09.240
uh probably I got accepted by a very

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.400
small

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.200
margin um that happened and yeah that's

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.799
how I got in gumroad on 17th June

00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:25.559
2024 very cool so that's interesting uh

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:27.720
though this this looks like it's a lot

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.440
of persistence and as you said these

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.000
markets are very fragile maybe he would

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.159
have forgotten maybe he forgot to

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:35.279
message uh but you put in a lot of input

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:38.600
um for example NE Royale for example um

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.039
you know spending a lot of time and even

00:24:40.039 --> 00:24:41.039
if it doesn't work out it doesn't work

00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:44.080
out um a lot of people with you know

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.039
let's say similar skills as you similar

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:48.440
intellect are stuck in a rut where you

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.960
know either they're not trying hard

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.640
enough or they're not as lucky as you

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.279
were or you know they did not get that

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:56.600
reply uh so do you have any suggestion

00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.159
for them we have only done this one

00:25:00.159 --> 00:25:04.240
time any advice I

00:25:06.919 --> 00:25:10.000
have repeated this but since I've only

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.399
done this once I can't say you're

00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:14.159
probably a much better person to ask for

00:25:14.159 --> 00:25:16.240
advice because you've done this so many

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.960
times and you're far more experienced

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.679
than

00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.360
me so can

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:26.000
advice but you got it recently in a

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.559
weird Market in not some hype company in

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:30.919
a very stable web to company that's

00:25:30.919 --> 00:25:32.320
doing you know very normal things which

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320
would there's no reason for them to hire

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.399
from India it's not like full stack

00:25:35.399 --> 00:25:37.960
Talent is hard to get in the US um still

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.000
you were able to convince them uh to

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.640
hire remotely initially so and you've

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.600
been working there for 6 months from

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.919
India only still getting us comp um

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:47.600
these offers are usually you know in a

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.399
very small Niche where it's hard to find

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:51.600
people in the US um what do you think

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.760
you did right there for me that has

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.399
never happened okay you know a full

00:25:54.399 --> 00:25:56.360
stack company is paying me thisy it's

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.720
either a web3 company or a web RTC

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.000
company there's some specific knowledge

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.880
that I'm bringing in um that gave me

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.640
leverage yeah I think if I look back on

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.159
it lots of luck

00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:10.880
obviously and also I

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:15.399
think I I kept F I kept focus on a

00:26:15.399 --> 00:26:18.120
single company for multiple months I

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.200
think like November start rejection I

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.320
leveled up a little bit took one more

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.640
step then I applied again um then that

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.360
sort of yeah as for more

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.159
stuff he said okay let's keep the train

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.679
going but to put in more effort more

00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:39.559
effort so he he built a s is an awesome

00:26:39.559 --> 00:26:42.279
Boss by the way I'll talk more about

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:45.000
gumroad um and the culture and how it's

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.399
a wonderful place but he sort of made

00:26:48.399 --> 00:26:51.120
this stepping stone for me which I was

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.840
lucky enough like maybe was light Dash I

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.559
was lucky enough to contribute so I had

00:26:56.559 --> 00:27:00.039
that in back of Mind next s Prisma

00:27:00.039 --> 00:27:03.520
postgress Etc this was my fresh in mind

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.640
so that I could use to get a few good

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.279
contributions in uh lesser time than I

00:27:08.279 --> 00:27:10.679
would have taken

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:13.679
otherwise

00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:18.559
so and just like I just kept pushing

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:22.159
right I honestly

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.720
thought and especially something so high

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.760
stakes and then parents

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.360
pressure wellers PR especially once you

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.919
drop out of college because I drop out I

00:27:36.919 --> 00:27:41.000
dropped out before getting a job oh yeah

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.320
so I dropped out in uh December 2020

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.320
three yeah Dropout so exact

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.559
Dropout I am from Ashoka University

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:55.360
which is which offers a BC in computer

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.360
science so that's a threee course but it

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.880
is recommended you take another fourth

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.200
year which is called the advanced

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.760
Scholars Program

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.240
ASP so I was in the first semester of

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.559
that advanced Scholars Program I had my

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:11.440
this BC degree but us may you need a

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.080
mandatory four years of higher education

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.120
and

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.000
Visa that's why like bch is four

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.159
years so most companies or most people

00:28:21.159 --> 00:28:22.480
wouldn't even accept this as a full

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.440
degree so that's why I call it as a

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.200
Dropout so after dropping out

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.360
I knew I can contribute and uh if

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:35.399
somebody takes a bet on me I won't

00:28:35.399 --> 00:28:37.840
disappoint at least based on proof of

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.640
work I'll try not to disappoint right so

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.159
yeah I just

00:28:43.159 --> 00:28:46.880
um kept on pushing kept on doing what um

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.360
I needed to do and I was lucky enough to

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:53.039
be able to do it that my abilities were

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:55.480
at a place where I could push myself to

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.679
that point got it and let's you did not

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:00.760
get in here uh what was your backup plan

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.679
after

00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:05.919
that no

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.240
backup I was interviewing at other

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.960
companies yeah if not 200k 100K 100 I

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.679
didn't have a figure in mind

00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:22.039
but why not try

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:43.159
and I feel a lot of developers feel this

00:29:43.159 --> 00:29:45.240
way it's it's just about getting your

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.080
foot in the door because most people can

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.960
do the

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.600
work so that getting foot in the door is

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.080
about impressing the other person is

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.519
about doing something that catches the

00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:58.320
other person's eye and honestly like how

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.640
do you know what will catch the other

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.799
person's eye like just try to surprise

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:05.480
yourself try to surpass your own

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.960
expectations right

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.480
right yeah that makes sense very cool

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:16.600
uh thinking if I have more questions uh

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.320
oh how was your negotiation or was it

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.279
pretty chill there was no

00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:24.080
negotiation fix it was uh $150 per hour

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.880
oh okay got it so it was a fixed comp

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.960
Global same pay

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.480
go and you're the only one from India

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.240
right now there are multiple people from

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.039
India um they're wonderful people by the

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:45.279
way so a couple of people Vish he's from

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:48.159
U so I won't name where name the place

00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:50.159
where he's from but he's a wonderful

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:53.200
senior there's harbaksh there were

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.399
there's Shang and there's they were

00:30:55.399 --> 00:30:58.120
originally in in India

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.399
and they've moved to Dubai I think so

00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:01.720
they're wonderful people they're from

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.159
India in fact gumroad actually laid off

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:07.240
all its employees in I think 2015

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:11.279
2016 and after that sahil reached out to

00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:14.240
this uh remote in firm Rubi on real from

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.840
called Big binary so the Shang Vishal

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.080
ashad harak they're all from Big binary

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.919
and they've they've they've done

00:31:23.919 --> 00:31:26.080
wonderful thems for themselves and uh

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:28.519
they've also guided me a lot

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:30.080
I would feel really lonely if I was the

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.159
only Indian there but these guys are

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:33.760
there and I can ask them anything

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.919
they're awesome even like everybody else

00:31:35.919 --> 00:31:39.080
as well like sahil as a boss

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.559
he it doesn't feel like he's a boss like

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.159
he doesn't make you feel like he's the

00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:47.559
BS and

00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:50.639
he's he's honestly like it's it's such a

00:31:50.639 --> 00:31:52.720
good working environment you have your

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.279
independent agency to do things like I I

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.519
fully built multiple features people are

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:59.600
giving full ownership of entire

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.519
products uh and

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:05.440
um everybody's sort of working in a

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:07.880
supportive way right everybody supports

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.120
each other and you also like you trust

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.679
other people to do stuff like

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.519
so to get something done like you have a

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.440
expectation that okay if this person

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.639
said they'll do it they do it and it's

00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:25.279
at a very high quality so for me who is

00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:28.440
very very early in my career it's such a

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:31.279
blessing to learn from these guys

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:34.799
and to Aspire to be like

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:37.600
them very cool what's your future plan

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.080
let's say 5 years down the

00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.480
line I have no

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.320
idea absolutely none let's see what

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.559
happens with with the

00:32:46.559 --> 00:32:50.080
VISA let's say the Visa gets approved I

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.840
go to New York right so I'll be working

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.840
with the G there's a lot of things we

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.120
need to do so

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.320
antiwork right formerly called gumroad

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.799
we have multiple products and we've

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:06.600
recently launched a few and we we want

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.880
to grow these products as well so

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.120
there's a lot of work to do and

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.399
uh we feel like we've cracked the code

00:33:17.399 --> 00:33:19.200
or at least we feel like we're pushing

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.000
AI usage uh much more than other people

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.399
um so that's what we're trying to

00:33:24.399 --> 00:33:26.840
capitalize on sahil talks a lot about

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.600
this on his tweets so you should go

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.120
check that out and

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.440
um there's a lot to do at gumroad so

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.279
let's see all right I've seen he has a

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:39.279
YouTube channel yeah he's posting stuff

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:41.960
I was looking at a video recently so

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.760
yeah very cool he had a tweet where he

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.039
said uh PMS are now 40x more productive

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:49.039
Engineers are 4X more productive and

00:33:49.039 --> 00:33:50.639
like some metrics around them what are

00:33:50.639 --> 00:33:53.799
your thoughts do you think you're more

00:33:54.399 --> 00:33:55.919
productive

00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:58.720
so if I look at myself I can't judge how

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.960
productive I am because I like I only

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.480
see

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.360
the the stuff that's blocking me right

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.240
and there's always stuff that's blocking

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:11.440
me now it's just that different stuff

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.560
blocks me so I would say ke yes there is

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.800
a big big Improvement how many times

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.879
that I can't see 2x at least 2

00:34:23.879 --> 00:34:27.159
3x initially we had hoped he'd be 10x

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:30.320
20x X but it's not that much it's it's

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:36.280
lower but it's it's a substantial

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:40.359
number that's true for PMS I'd say this

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:44.399
is more true for PMS uh engineering less

00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:47.280
so because the problem with using AI for

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.000
engineering is even though you should

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.159
use it everybody should use

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:54.919
AI when you get stuck you have to

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:56.960
understand everything from the beginning

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.760
of what AI started so if you try to

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.200
solve a particular problem and AI solves

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.079
like 80% of it to solve the remaining 20

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:06.920
you have to understand the 0 so it

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.599
effectively when you're in this

00:35:08.599 --> 00:35:11.800
situation it ends up taking as much time

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.880
as it would have if you did it without

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.480
AI but AI is a great way to quickly

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.760
access information like earlier you had

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.680
to search for uh like a particular bug

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.599
fix or you had to search

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:28.520
um uh like some specific documentation

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.920
detail now all of that is in the weights

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.400
of the llm so you just need to ask it

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.960
something and it gives it to you and

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.560
it's it's a great knowledge retrieval

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.680
tool and soon to be a great

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.599
um engineering tool it's already a great

00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:47.960
engineering tool but um a really good

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.520
coding tool as

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.480
well yeah oh that's it I think that's

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.800
all I had do you have anything else to

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.920
add I do want to add something um first

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.800
of all this wouldn't have been possible

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.359
without all the people who have made me

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:03.680
who I

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:06.180
am um my parents

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.960
[Music]

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.560
who you really can't uh like I wouldn't

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.319
be anything without them right they

00:36:13.319 --> 00:36:15.880
raised me and they've come from pretty

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.800
humble backgrounds as well I've heard

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.480
stories where uh 20 or 25 years ago when

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.520
I was I think a baby or not even born

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:27.440
they lived in a nagar and they uh there

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.319
were was the like very small room and

00:36:29.319 --> 00:36:31.760
when Nana Nani D Dadi used to come to

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.440
somebody used to sleep on the table

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.839
table

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.680
Pia so they've they've built themselves

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.520
up they've built themselves up and given

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.319
me a life where um I haven't had to

00:36:50.319 --> 00:36:52.720
worry about financial backing so I'm

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.920
very very grateful for that much of any

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.599
everything that I've been able to do has

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.599
has been

00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:02.000
because I have had that security key my

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.480
parents are there and they're always

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.880
there for me and I can't thank them

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.040
enough for

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.960
that also would like to thank my brother

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.119
who's always been there for me um great

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:17.680
inspiration I would like to extremely

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.839
grateful for uh my best friend and

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:24.240
partner she's um stuck with me in the

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:29.720
thick and thin uh and uh she's awesome

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.839
all my professors at Asoka all my school

00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:36.040
teachers um one one thing I particularly

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.160
remember is a course um introduction to

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.160
computer programming by Shish banerji

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.400
that

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:48.000
course made M played a huge part in the

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.480
program programmer I am it was the

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.480
hardest course I've ever taken but it it

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.560
shaped me and I'll always be indied to

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.640
him for that

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.480
uh my school teachers who pushed me

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.680
college professors okay and through

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.920
college right I got to know about you

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.240
and you've been a huge part you've been

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.480
a big part in this entire

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.720
thing if it wasn't for your videos

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.319
I obviously I wouldn't be here

00:38:18.319 --> 00:38:21.240
right and there are so many people I

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.240
can't even remember but from my little U

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.520
intellect that I can Master right now

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.760
trying to name all the names the last

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.680
and final person who's actually on

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.040
the highest on the list is Swami G and I

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.200
wanted to keep him for last because

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.920
um won't be able to stop talking about

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.440
him so um yeah Swami G is actually how

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.640
my journey started I was in college and

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.160
I was about to drop out essentially my

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.280
first year at College was very very bad

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.560
and and I

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.880
think we have a GPS system 4.0 is the

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.440
highest

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:10.079
2.3 first year I failed a few courses

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.640
got I was also interested in

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.240
spirituality and I wanted to learn from

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:22.640
Swami G so he was the

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.920
one everything failed M then reached out

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:29.359
to swam

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:34.599
then Swami intervened and he he sort of

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:40.359
told me spirituality is not for

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.319
losers then he said now go back to

00:39:45.319 --> 00:39:46.800
college and you have to come first in

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.520
everything that you do like all the

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.119
courses you have to come first like all

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:53.760
a and then I I pushed hard and he pushed

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.800
me and he

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.160
was Life movie

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.160
but he was the one who pushed me really

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:04.160
really hard to um do that even in my job

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.520
period when I was in my third year I

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.440
think before IID met you he was the one

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.119
my pressure by current like people

00:40:11.119 --> 00:40:13.079
younger than you are are like working a

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:15.400
job together they earning crores in

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.920
money and um they they're doing their

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:20.359
college degree as well people in high

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:21.680
school are doing

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.040
this so

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.520
uh that sort of pressure and because he

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.680
knew I was interested in spirituality

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.000
and I haven't found a replacement for my

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.760
uh interest in

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.319
spirituality if you don't if you can't

00:40:43.319 --> 00:40:45.640
succeed in the material world what will

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.359
you do in the spiritual world because

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:49.520
spiritual the spiritual world is 100

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.800
times harder than the material world so

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:55.000
it's not for losers and mostly 99%

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.040
losers spiritual world you have to you

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.800
have to earn at

00:41:09.319 --> 00:41:13.000
least so he's he's been through thick

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.680
and thing for

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:26.240
