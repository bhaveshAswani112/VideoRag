Working for selection and direction of location

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.220
Team making video is a cricket or

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.020
Football works like Team

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.605

Or to win the team assuming it

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.665
Let's work in the same way

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.805
All members of Team making video

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:51.960
A captain to make a better video

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:09.649
Will talk about and know that

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:12.945
What are their during the process of making video

00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:15.985
What are the major roles of Close UP

00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:18.785
After taking long shoots, it will look good. No

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:20.310
No I think Close up Shot

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.310
After taking the close up shot of another also

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.070
What is there or any jerk or

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.470
No shock will come and then after that

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.510
Long Shot will take perfect

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.670
Can also take OTS and yes Dia

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.990
Even if it is a little longer

00:01:33.990 --> 00:02:05.985
According to script

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:09.085
Ho and where you have to show the video

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:12.125
Be according to the place. Also video

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.425
The things being shown or told technical

00:02:15.565 --> 00:02:19.150
Be correct. All after scripting

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.310
People together form a storyboard in which it is clear

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.590
It is clearly written on which dialogue

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.650
What is the angle of which shot to take

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:46.470
What will be script and sound in which Seen

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.930
Who will be responsible and who will handle the location

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.410
During this time the decision of the director is final.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.510
So see script and direction I see this

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.482
Luni and Gita you are Sound's Camera

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.277
You do not take care of you, Raju

00:03:05.277 --> 00:03:08.072
Background management is okay to take care

00:03:08.072 --> 00:03:10.867
No noise from behind is fine

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.662
Apart from this, Reflect and Diffuser work

00:03:13.662 --> 00:03:17.300
I will also handle it exactly yes

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300
Camera's sound would see

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.620
Yes, everyone said the thing about the team

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.340
If you have given this way this video

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.860
I saw how a director is his team

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.165
Selections of script and shorts together

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:34.765
The next plays an important role in my own

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:37.585
