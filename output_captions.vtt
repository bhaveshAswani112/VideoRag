Working for selection and direction of location

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.220
Team making video is a cricket or

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.020
Football works like Team

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.605

Or to win the team assuming it

00:00:42.465 --> 00:00:45.665
Let's work in the same way

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:48.805
All members of Team making video

00:00:48.945 --> 00:00:51.960
A captain to make a better video

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100
Follow the order of which we

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.440
Director or director says this today

About the head director or director of

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.225
I will talk and know that video

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:13.265
What are their during the process of making

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.305
Key roles are after Close UP

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.945
Take long shoots will look good. No. No.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.710
I think after close up shot

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.710
The other also takes close up shot

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.230
What is there or no one

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.710
The shock will not come and then after that long

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.830

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.910
Can also take and yes diague

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.335
Even if it is a little longer then it is a little

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:06.605
The character has a sense according to script

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:09.485
And where you have to show the video, the same place

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.365
Be according to Also in video

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.885
The things being shown or told technically

00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:19.310
Be right from Everyone after scripting

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.550
Together we create a storyboard. In which it is clear

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.670
It is written on which dialogue

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.870
To take a shot? What will be his angle?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:46.790
What script and sound in which Scene

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.950
Whose responsibility will be and who will handle the location

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.630
During the time the director's decision is final. So

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.090
Watch script and direction i will see this

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.015
